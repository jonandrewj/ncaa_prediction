\section{Conclusion}
Predicting a perfect bracket, given the 9.2 quadrillion permutations, remains difficult, even with the aid of modern machine learning models.
To reiterate our findings included:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Baseline prediction using only seeding data and choosing the higher seed to win generally yields around 70\% accuracy.
	\item Improved predictions can be made by using team statistics and rankings, though these improvements are generally only by a few percentage points.
	\item If a perfect bracket is to be found, the upsets must be inserted and can be better guessed using probabilistic methods.
\end{enumerate}

While the perfect bracket may remain a guessing game, producing a set of strong brackets to compete against friends, family, and colleagues with is certainly obtainable.
